### Signature
public static java.lang.String toString(java.lang.Object[] a)
### Comment
...
The value returned by this method is equal to the value that would
be returned by Arrays.asList(a).toString(), unless a is null, in
which case "null" is returned.
### Analysis
This method returns the same thing as the expression
Arrays.asList(a).toString(), therefore they are equivalent
(at least as long as a is not null).
### Equivalence
if (a != null) toString(a) <-> Arrays.asList(a).toString() ;
...

### Signature
public double norm2(cern.colt.matrix.DoubleMatrix1D x)
